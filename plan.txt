PRIMARY FOCUS: LeetCode-style Hackathon Platform with Live Proctoring
============================================================================

This application is a comprehensive assessment and hackathon platform with a primary focus on live, proctored coding challenges similar to HackerRank and LeetCode. Teams compete in real-time coding sessions with professional Monaco editors, visible test cases, and comprehensive proctoring features.

Needs (Functional Requirements)
User roles & permissions
Applicant/Fellow (test-taker): take timed assessments; upload files; see their own results/feedback when released.
Proctor/Instructor/TA: start/stop sessions, identity check, live monitor, incident log, pause/resume, override time.
Grader: access submissions, use rubric, leave comments, assign scores, request regrade.
Judge (hackathon): view team/project pages, score via rubric, leave notes; see leaderboard context (not live until reveal).
Admin: CRUD for users, roles, orgs/cohorts, banks, exams; set policies (proctoring, retake rules, late windows).
Assessment authoring
Question types: multiple choice (single/multi-select), freeform/short answer, long-form, coding (in-browser editor & test runner), and file-upload prompts (e.g., slide deck, dataset, design).
Logic/branching: show/hide sections by answer, randomization (question order, option order), pools with weights.
Versioning: draft → review → publish; immutable published snapshots.
Delivery & proctoring
Sessions: timed windows, start/end, per-student time accommodations, autosubmit on timeout.
Identity & integrity: pre-check (photo ID confirmation), tab-change detection, copy/paste/print detection, optional webcam + mic recording and periodic snapshots (with consent), IP/device fingerprint logging.
Environment controls: disable back/forward, optional fullscreen/lockdown reminder, calculator/notes toggle (built-in scratchpad).
Incidents: automatic flags (excess tab switches, idle), manual proctor notes; timestamps for all events.
Coding questions (LeetCode-style interface)
Editor: Monaco editor with Python/JS/Java support, syntax highlighting, line numbers, folding, word wrap.
Live coding: real-time code editing with autosave, visible test cases with input/output examples.
Code execution: integrated test runner with per-test scoring, time/memory limits, deterministic sandbox.
Problem display: clear descriptions, constraints, examples; supports Codewars API integration.
Test cases: visible examples for debugging, hidden tests for validation; point-based scoring.
Submissions & artifacts

File attachments: PDFs, images, code zips, etc., with size/type limits and virus scan.
Audit trail: immutable event log per attempt.
Grading & rubrics
Rubrics: point scales, criteria, descriptors; per-question and overall; reusable templates.
Workflows: self-assign or queue; double-blind optional; discrepancy resolution; regrade requests.
Feedback: inline comments (code lines, freeform text), rubric feedback, summary; release controls.
Hackathon mode (PRIMARY FOCUS - LeetCode-style with live proctoring)
Teams & projects: team registration, repo/link fields, short description, demo video link.
Live coding interface: Monaco editor with Python/JS/Java support, visible test cases, real-time code execution.
Problem selection: Teams choose from imported Codewars problems or custom questions in database.
Live proctoring: tab-switch detection, copy-paste blocking, window focus monitoring, incident logging.
Team dashboard: problem browser, code editor, test results display, submission interface.
Judging forms: configurable rubric per track; private judge notes; conflict of interest flag.
Standings page: real-time hidden leaderboard for admins; public reveal at scheduled time; tie-break rules.
Results & analytics
Scores: per-question, per-section, overall; pass/fail rules; skill tags.
Reports: cohort distribution, item analysis (difficulty/discrimination), proctoring flags, time-on-task.
Exports: CSV/JSON; PDF report per candidate.
Integrations (phaseable)
SSO: Google/Microsoft; optional email/password.
LMS/CRM hooks (later): Canvas grade push, Monday.com status updates, GitHub repo links.
Webhooks: submission-created, grade-released, incident-flagged.
Security, privacy, compliance
Data protection: role-based access, TLS, encrypted at rest; PII minimization.
Recording: explicit consent banner; retention policy; regional storage.
Reliability: autosave, resume after disconnect, idempotent submits; scalable stateless services.
Project Scope
MVP (8–12 core epics)
User & auth: roles/permissions, org/cohort scoping.
Question bank: MCQ, freeform, coding; tags, difficulty; versioning.
Assessment builder: sections, timers, randomization; publish snapshots.
Delivery & autosave: timed sessions, accommodations, autosubmit, mobile-restricted UI.
Basic proctoring: tab-change & blur detection, IP/device log, incident notes; (recording optional flag placeholder).
Coding runner (Monaco editor integration): Python primary with JS/Java support; visible test cases display; per-test scoring; sandbox queue for code execution.
Submissions with attachments: file upload to secure object storage; audit log; timestamps.
Grading UI + rubrics: criteria, inline comments, draft → submit grade → release.
Results pages & export: per-student report, CSV export; simple item stats.
Hackathon essentials: team pages with live coding interface, problem selection from database/Codewars, judge rubric form, offline leaderboard, reveal toggle.
Admin controls: banks, exams, cohorts; accommodation settings; retention policies.
Analytics lite: time-on-task, flag counts, per-item correctness.
