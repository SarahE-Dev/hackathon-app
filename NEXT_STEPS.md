## üöÄ Immediate Setup (Do This First!)

### Step 1: Install & Configure
- [ ] Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- [ ] Run `docker-compose up -d mongodb redis` to start databases

- [ ] Generate JWT secrets:
  ```bash
  echo "JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" >> .env
  echo "JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" >> .env
  ```

### Step 2: Seed Database
- [ ] Run `npm run seed` to create sample data

- Code execution
- Grading interface
- Hackathon features

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start with Session/Attempt** - This unblocks the entire test-taking flow
2. **Build Frontend Auth Next** - Users need to login before anything else
3. **Test Frequently** - Don't wait until everything is done
4. **Use Postman** - Test APIs as you build them
5. **Read the Docs** - All documentation is in the repo
6. **Git Commits** - Commit often with clear messages
7. **Ask for Help** - Check IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md for guidance

---

## üéâ You've Got This!

The foundation is solid. Authentication works. Database is designed. API structure is in place.

**Just follow this checklist** and you'll have a working platform in 6-8 weeks.

Start with Step 1 above and work your way down. üöÄ

**Happy coding!**
