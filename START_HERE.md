# 🚀 START HERE - Your Hackathon Proctoring Platform

Welcome! I've built a **production-ready foundation** for your platform. Here's everything you need to know to get started.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

```bash
# 1. Install everything
npm install

# 2. Start databases
docker-compose up -d mongodb redis

# 3. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
echo "JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" >> .env
echo "JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" >> .env

# 4. Add sample data
npm run seed

# 5. Start development
npm run dev
```

**You're running!** 🎉
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:3001

## ✅ What Works Now

### Backend API (30+ endpoints)
✅ User registration and login (JWT)
✅ User management (CRUD with RBAC)
✅ Question bank (all 6 question types)
✅ Assessment builder
✅ Publishing workflow (immutable snapshots)

### Database (12 models)
✅ Users, Organizations, Questions, Assessments
✅ Sessions, Attempts, Grades, Rubrics
✅ Teams, JudgeScores, Leaderboard, ProctorEvents

### Infrastructure
✅ Authentication middleware
✅ Rate limiting
✅ Error handling
✅ Logging (Winston)
✅ WebSocket setup (Socket.io)

---

## 🧪 Test It Out

### 1. Login with Sample Account

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@demo.edu",
    "password": "Admin123!"
  }'
```

Save the `accessToken` from the response!

### 2. Get Current User

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/auth/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### 3. List Questions

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/assessments/questions/list \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

You'll see 3 sample questions (MCQ, Coding, Freeform)!

### 4. List Assessments

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/assessments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

You'll see 1 sample assessment with 3 sections!

## 🎯 Next Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Session/Attempt System (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Why**: This enables users to actually take tests
**Time**: 1-2 weeks
**What**: Create session and attempt controllers

### Phase 2: Frontend Pages (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Why**: Users need a UI
**Time**: 1-2 weeks
**What**: Login, dashboard, test-taking interface

### Phase 3: Real-time Proctoring (MEDIUM)
**Why**: Core feature for integrity
**Time**: 1 week
**What**: WebSocket handlers, proctor dashboard

### Phase 4: Code Execution (MEDIUM)
**Why**: Run coding challenges
**Time**: 1-2 weeks
**What**: Docker sandbox, BullMQ worker

### Phase 5: Grading (MEDIUM)
**Why**: Complete the workflow
**Time**: 1 week
**What**: Grading interface, rubric application

### Phase 6: Hackathon Features (LOW)
**Why**: Specialized use case
**Time**: 1 week
**What**: Teams, judging, leaderboard

### Troubleshooting

**MongoDB won't start?**
```bash
docker-compose down
docker volume rm hackathon-app_mongodb_data
docker-compose up -d mongodb
```

**Port 3000/3001 in use?**
```bash
lsof -i :3000
kill -9 <PID>
```

**TypeScript errors?**
```bash
npm install
npm run build --workspace=shared
```

### Database Access

```bash
# MongoDB shell
docker exec -it hackathon-mongodb mongosh

# Inside mongosh:
use hackathon-platform
show collections
db.users.find()

# Redis CLI
docker exec -it hackathon-redis redis-cli
```
